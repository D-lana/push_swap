<h1 align="center">Push_swap</h1>


```ruby
This project make sort data on a "stack", with a limited set of instructions,
using the lowest possible number of actions.
```
The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: <b>data must be sorted</b>.

It have <ins>a set of integer values</ins>, <ins>2 stacks</ins>, and <ins>a set of instructions</ins> to manipulate both stacks.

<b>Goal:</b> write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.
